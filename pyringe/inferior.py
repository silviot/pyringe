### RPC protocol for gdb service ###
#
# In order to ensure compatibility with all versions of python JSON was
# chosen as the main data format for the communication protocol between
# the gdb-internal python process and the process using this module.
# RPC requests to GdbService ('the service') are JSON objects containing exactly
# two keys:
# * 'func' : the name of the function to be called in the service. RPCs for
#            function names starting with _ will be rejected by the service.
# * 'args' : An array containing all the parameters for the function. Due to
#            JSON's limitations, only positional arguments work. Most API
#            functions require a 'position' argument which is required to be a
#            3-element array specifying the selected pid, python thread id and
#            depth of the selected frame in the stack (where 0 is the outermost
#            frame).
# The session is terminated upon sending an RPC request for the function
# '__kill__' (upon which args are ignored).
#
# RPC return values are not wrapped in JSON objects, but are bare JSON
# representations of return values.
# Python class instances (old and new-style) will also be serialized to JSON
# objects with keys '__pyringe_type_name__' and '__pyringe_address__', which
# carry the expected meaning. The remaining keys in these objects are simple
# JSON representations of the attributes visible in the instance (this means the
# object includes class-level attributes, but these are overshadowed by any
# instance attributes. (There is currently no recursion in this representation,
# only one level of object references is serialized in this way.)
# Should an exception be raised to the top level within the service, it will
# write a JSON-representation of the traceback string to stderr

# TODO: add message-id to the protocol to make sure that canceled operations
# that never had their output read don't end up supplying output for the wrong
# command
